### Technologies used :floppy_disk:
- Vanilla Javascript 1.16.3
- CSS 3
- Bootstrap 5.2
- HTML 5


## Completed steps :heavy_check_mark:

### UI :art:
- [x] Show HTML macrocomponent skeleton
- [x] Apply just enough CSS so as to visually structure my components in DOM


## WIP :construction:

### JS Logic :wrench:
 
- [ ] Build a test function that brings the data of the first "Car" key, containing all the data I will need to input in my first card
     (Each card needs to also contain Rate Information / Inclusions!)
- [ ] Extend the previous function so as to populate Car cards A - Z

Filters (Dropdown Menu & Functionality Checkbox): 

- [ ] Build an onSelected function that returns the Objects tagged with the pertinent filters (first on console, then printed on the DOM) when I click on the Dropdown menu Group link, or else when I choose one or more of my Functionality Checkbox filters.
