Steps:
UI
X Show HTML macrocomponent skeleton
X Apply just enough CSS so as to visually structure my components in DOM

JS Logic

- Build a test function that brings the data of the first "Car" key, containing all the data I will need to input in my first card
  // Each card needs to also contain Rate Information / Inclusions!
- Extend the previous function so as to populate Car cards A - Z
- Filters (Dropdown Menu & Functionality Checkbox): Build an onSelected function that returns the Objects tagged with the pertinent filters (first on console, then printed on the DOM) when I click on the Dropdown menu Group link, or else when I choose one or more of my Functionality Checkbox filters.
